**Disclaimer: No warranties. Use at your own risk.**

## Parameters
* **-AuditLogLevel**, Audit log level of all three logon types (Administrator, Delegate, Owner) to be set on all mailboxes. Only two valid inputs; 'Default' and 'Full'.
* **-AuditLogAgeLimit**, Determines how long audit log entries will be retained (in days) on all mailboxes. Default value is 90.
* **-AutomationPSCredentialName**, Name of the Automation Credential used when connecting to Exchange Online.
* **-ForceUpdate**, If this switch is present, the script will force a 'Set' command, regardless of whether the log settings match the desired settings or not.
* **-EnableVerbose**, If this switch is present, 'VerbosePreference' will be set to "Continue" in the script.

## Examples
